## 1. Project Summary

The Implicit CAD Modeler is a code-first, SDF-based (signed distance field) parametric geometry system. Users write Rhai scripts to build geometry through primitives, booleans, and transforms. A native desktop viewer (egui + wgpu) renders the result in a two-pane layout: code editor on the left, 3D viewport on the right.

**Core philosophy**: geometry is a computable field, not a mesh. A sphere is `f(x,y,z) = length(xyz) - r`, not a collection of triangles. Meshes are extracted at the final step only. Historically this repo has used marching-cubes-based extraction for STL/export work; keep that material as reference for legacy behavior, not as an assumption about the forward export direction. This enables smooth SDF blends, variable offsets, and topology-independent booleans.

**Inspiration**: nTop (SDF-based modeling) and OpenSCAD (code-first UI).

**Primary target OS**: Windows (DX12 via wgpu). Architecture is cross-platform ready.

**Language**: Rust + Rhai scripting language.

### 1.1 Start Here

If you are a new agent picking up work, read these files in this order:

1. `CLAUDE.md` â€” local agent working rules and repo-specific expectations.
2. `MasterPlan.md` â€” high-level product goals.
3. `AGENT_REFERENCE.md` â€” this file; current codebase and workflow summary.
4. `output.md` â€” current export/debug log history.
5. `scratchpad.md` â€” current queued task, if the user is actively driving work through it.

Then inspect the current active code path before changing anything:

- `src/mesh/adaptive_mc.rs`
- `src/export/aero.rs`
- `src/mesh/marching_cubes.rs`
- `scratchpad_plane.rhai`
- `tmp_inlet_only_debug.rhai`
- `bwb_edf_800.rhai`

### 1.2 Current Project State

This repo is not in a generic greenfield state. The recent active engineering problem has been STL/aero export topology reliability for adaptive mesh extraction on aircraft-like SDF geometry.

Current status as of 2026-05-14:

- The core product is still an SDF-first CAD/modeling system written in Rust with a Rhai scripting front-end and egui/wgpu viewer.
- The viewer, scripting engine, aerospace primitives, and headless export paths are present and usable.
- The current weak subsystem is the existing adaptive aero meshing/export path, centered on `src/mesh/adaptive_mc.rs`.
- The main open problem is topology preservation across adaptive extraction, welding, transition repair, and coarse/fine boundary handling.
- Recent high-signal work has used narrow standalone repros like `wing_safe` and `inlet_only`, not full-aircraft sweeps.
- Treat the current marching-cubes/octree/aero STL path as legacy reference material that may be removed or replaced. Keep its diagnostics and failure history because they explain what was tried and what to avoid, but do not assume new export work should extend that path.

Recent debugging conclusions that matter immediately:

- Raw marching-cubes emission is not the only failure mode. In at least one clean repro (`wing_safe`), the first large-epsilon weld pass was shown to be a primary topology breaker.
- The adaptive path now contains several targeted repair stages:
  - constrained weld behavior
  - boundary-edge pairing repair
  - guarded T-junction repair
  - tiny-loop fill
  - late duplicate/degenerate cleanup
- These improve narrow repros materially, but do not yet make the inlet transition corridor reliable.
- Remaining inlet defects are concentrated around coarse/fine transition layout, especially `PartialOverlap` and true different-size edge-contact cases.
- `transition_emission` currently handles only exact coarse/fine face tilings. It does not solve the edge-contact T-junction class that dominates the inlet corridor diagnostics.
- `EdgeTransitionRecord` collection and a first `emit_edge_transitions(...)` prototype now exist in `adaptive_mc.rs`, but the first pass emitted zero triangles because it could not reconstruct the needed fine half-edge endpoints reliably.

What not to assume:

- `scratchpad.md` is a task queue, not authoritative architecture documentation.
- A visually acceptable viewer result does not mean STL topology is acceptable.
- `balance_surface_cells` is not currently a complete enforcement pass for conforming transitions.
- More refinement alone is not a complete fix. Several tests already showed that increased local refinement without conforming transitions is insufficient or regressive.

### 1.3 Sandbox Clone: dual_contouring

A fully separate sandbox clone now exists at `dual_contouring/`.

Purpose:

- experiment with a new export option such as dual contouring
- perform invasive meshing work without destabilizing the main workspace

Important facts:

- It is a near-full mirror of the main repo created on 2026-05-14.
- It includes its own `.git`, source tree, scripts, shaders, tests, copied artifacts, and build tree.
- It has already been built independently inside the clone.
- Its separate executable is `dual_contouring/target/release/implicit-cad.exe`.

Workflow rule:

- Use `dual_contouring/` for new export-backend experiments.
- Use the main repo for maintaining or auditing the current adaptive-MC/aero path unless the user explicitly wants the experiment moved.
- Be explicit in notes, commits, and logs about which tree you are editing.

### 1.4 Current Working Files

The most relevant current files are:

- `src/mesh/adaptive_mc.rs`
  - adaptive extraction, welding, transition diagnostics, boundary repair, and current experimental transition-edge work
- `src/export/aero.rs`
  - aero export orchestration and cleanup stages
- `src/mesh/marching_cubes.rs`
  - base marching-cubes extraction logic
- `output.md`
  - chronological debug log of recent export/mesh investigations
- `scratchpad.md`
  - current queued task prompt from the user
- `scratchpad_plane.rhai`
  - updated scratchpad aircraft model using current export-safe tools
- `tmp_inlet_only_debug.rhai`
  - narrow standalone inlet repro used for transition-layout and repair testing
- `bwb_edf_800.rhai`
  - broader aircraft model

Current model notes:

- `scratchpad_plane.rhai` was restored and modernized from the old deleted root script.
- Its inlet was intentionally made much smaller than the old version, then widened by 50 percent.
- The current scratchpad aero export configuration is expensive because it enables many local refinement regions and spline-path refinement boxes.

### Notes on Key Dependencies

**eframe/egui**: The wgpu feature flag is mandatory — it switches egui's rendering backend from the default glow (OpenGL) to wgpu (DX12 on Windows). All custom rendering (mesh display, grid, axes, section view, raymarch preview) runs as custom wgpu passes inside the egui frame.

**rhai**: Scripts are evaluated in a fresh `Engine` per evaluation call. All SDF functions are registered as native Rust closures. The engine does NOT persist state across evaluations.

**glam**: All geometry uses `Vec3` (f32). The SDF trait operates on `Vec3`. Distance values are `f32`. Quaternions (`Quat`) are used for rotations internally; scripts take Euler angles in degrees which are converted in the API layer.

**rayon**: Used in marching cubes (`adaptive_mc`) to parallelize the grid evaluation. Also used in thickness computation and some analysis passes.

**indexmap**: Used for `dimensions` in the project file so that named constants appear in a consistent insertion-order in the UI.

### Data Flow (Normal Evaluation)

1. User writes or edits a Rhai script in the code editor pane.
2. User triggers evaluation (Run button or Ctrl+Enter).
3. `scripting::evaluate_script_full()` creates a fresh Rhai `Engine`, registers all SDF functions, evaluates the script.
4. The script builds an SDF tree (a tree of `Arc<dyn Sdf>` nodes). The last expression is the root.
5. `ScriptResult` is returned containing: `sdf`, `mass_points`, `fea_setup`, `layups`, `reference_points`.
6. `adaptive_mc::extract_mesh()` runs marching cubes on the SDF over a bounding volume. Parallelized via rayon.
7. The resulting `Mesh` (vertices + indices) is uploaded to the GPU as a wgpu vertex/index buffer.
8. The render loop draws the mesh with flat or smooth shading, plus optional overlays (wireframe, grid, axes, section clip planes, thickness map).

## 5. Module Reference

### 5.1 `sdf` — Geometry Kernel

**Path**: `src/sdf/`

#### Core Trait

```rust
pub trait Sdf: Send + Sync {
    fn distance(&self, point: Vec3) -> f32;
    fn metadata(&self) -> SdfNodeMetadata;
}
```

All geometry is represented as types implementing `Sdf`. The `distance` function returns:
- Negative value: point is **inside** the shape
- Zero: point is **on the surface**
- Positive value: point is **outside** the shape

All SDF types are wrapped in `Arc<dyn Sdf>` for shared ownership. This is the fundamental composition mechanism — booleans and transforms hold `Arc<dyn Sdf>` children.

#### Conditioning (`sdf/conditioning.rs`)

Initial backend foundation for robust SDF conditioning. This is core geometry
kernel code, not downstream automation plumbing.

- `DirtyRegion`: records local geometry changes and halo bounds.
- `GeometryEdit`: records live kernel edits such as blend-radius changes.
- `GeometryEditTransaction`: groups one or more emitted edits into a single
  live model mutation.
- `condition_sdf_after_backend_edit(previous, next_canonical)`: advances an
  existing `ConditionedGeometryKernel` snapshot with metadata-derived dirty
  regions when possible, falling back to fresh backend conditioning when the
  previous SDF is not conditioned or the new graph cannot be bounded.
- `ConditionedGeometryKernel`: owns the active canonical SDF graph and its
  conditioned cache so edits and cache conditioning are applied together. Its
  `distance()` method and `Sdf` implementation prefer conditioned cache values
  only when they preserve the canonical graph's inside/outside sign; they fall
  back to canonical distance outside the cache domain or on sign mismatch. It
  also exposes first-class conditioned geometry queries for inside/outside
  classification, closest-surface projection, ray intersection, gradients, and
  normals. Projection attempts the conditioned path first and then falls back to
  canonical projection if the cache path cannot converge.
- `ConditionedGeometryModel`: owns conditioned block state, generations,
  dirty history, local/full regeneration decisions, and conditioned-distance
  cache queries.
- `ConditionedCacheQualityDiagnostics`: reports live cache sign mismatch,
  surface residual, gradient error percentiles, and confidence.
- `recondition_signed_distance_samples()`: restores generated block samples
  toward signed-distance behavior using exact-zero anchors, edge-crossing
  interface anchors, projection/gradient-corrected near-interface anchors, and
  eight-direction fast sweeping.
- `ReconditioningReport`: records sample count, active narrow-band sample count,
  anchor count, projection-anchor count, sweep iteration count, maximum sweep
  change, whether fast sweeping ran, and whether the sparse narrow-band fallback
  was used.
- `ReconditioningStats`: aggregate update-summary stats for regenerated block
  count, reconditioned block count, narrow-band block/sample count, anchor
  count, projection-anchor count, max iteration count, and max conditioning
  change.
- `SdfNodeMetadata`: live graph metadata reported by SDF nodes, including node
  kind, support bounds, feature IDs, child dependencies, approximate-bound
  compatibility flags, explicit bound quality, parameter fingerprints,
  operation/interface dirty-propagation metadata, and optional live conditioned
  cache metadata.
- `ConditionedCacheMetadata`: optional `SdfNodeMetadata` payload attached by
  `ConditionedGeometryKernel::metadata()` with cache state, generation, block
  count, grid spacing, interface band, confidence, anchor counts, narrow-band
  block count, and max iteration count.
- `BoundQuality`: labels support bounds as `Exact`, `Conservative`,
  `Estimated`, or `Unknown`. Local conditioning may use exact, conservative, and
  estimated bounds with the appropriate diagnostics; unknown bounds are a full
  rebuild signal.
- `audit_conditionable_geometry()` / `assert_conditionable_geometry()`:
  dependency-tree audits that reject missing support bounds, invalid bounds, or
  unknown bound quality before local conditioning relies on the metadata.
- `FeatureTaggedSdf`: attaches feature ownership to an SDF subtree so local
  edits, diagnostics, and future query APIs can trace affected geometry back to
  the owning feature.
- `ConditioningPolicy`: stores sampling and acceptance thresholds.
  `max_region_sample_count` bounds dense connected-region solves; oversized
  components are split deterministically before reconditioning. Oversized
  regions that still exceed the dense budget use a sparse narrow-band solve.
  `local_validation_mode` selects the default real-time local cache-quality
  validator or the stricter full-comparison regression validator.
- `ConditioningDiagnostics`: reports local-vs-full error, sign mismatches,
  gradient error, cache state, and confidence.
- `compare_local_update_to_full()` and `compare_local_update_regions_to_full()`:
  diagnostic harnesses for proving whether local updates cover the same
  near-interface geometry as full recomputation.

The conditioned field is integral kernel-owned state. It is still derived and
disposable; the canonical SDF graph remains the source of truth.

Rhai evaluation now enters this backend path by default. `evaluate_script_full`,
`evaluate_script_cells`, component preview extraction, aero export part
extraction, and refinement SDF extraction all pass returned SDF handles through
`condition_sdf_for_backend(...)`. If the graph metadata is conditionable, the
handle is a `ConditionedGeometryKernel`; if not, the raw SDF remains evaluable
and the metadata/audit gap is explicit. Do not add exporter-owned conditioning
wrappers around script results.

`ScriptResult` also carries `canonical_sdf`. Backend/UI edit paths that have a
previous model should call `condition_sdf_after_backend_edit(...)` with the
previous conditioned SDF plus the new canonical graph, not wrap the new graph
from scratch. The app's script, cell, dimension, profile, spine, component, and
snippet mutation paths follow this pattern so normal edits feed the same live
conditioned cache.

Backend bounds should prefer live metadata where safe. `pipeline::auto_bounds()`
uses finite `SdfNodeMetadata::support_bounds` with padding before broad SDF
sampling. `sdf::query::bounding_points()` only uses metadata when
`BoundQuality::Exact`; conservative aircraft envelopes still use directional
searches so analysis dimensions are not silently widened.

Regeneration groups affected cache blocks into connected components, expands
each component with a ghost-cell halo, samples the canonical SDF over that
region, derives fixed interface anchors from exact zero samples and
sign-changing grid edges, adds projection-style near-interface anchors from
`abs(phi) / abs(grad phi)`, then fast-sweeps the absolute field to satisfy
`|grad phi| = 1` before restoring the canonical sign and splitting the region
back into cache blocks. Full rebuilds use the same connected-region path.
Disjoint dirty components are solved separately so local work does not fill the
empty space between unrelated edits. Same-sign near-interface samples can now
seed conditioning through projection anchors even when no grid edge crosses the
surface.

Dense region size is bounded by `ConditioningPolicy::max_region_sample_count`.
Oversized components split along their widest block-index axis, then each split
is reconnected and solved recursively. Single blocks are the minimum unit and
may exceed the budget. Keep the budget high enough for normal dirty-region
halos; setting it too low can reduce cross-block conditioning context.

When a region still exceeds the dense budget, regeneration switches to a sparse
narrow-band store. It samples active grid points near the interface, includes
edge-crossing anchors plus a small halo, fast-sweeps only those active samples,
and falls back to canonical samples outside the active band when extracting the
dense cache block. This keeps oversized updates finite without moving
conditioning out of the geometry kernel.

Aero export patch bounds now prefer live SDF metadata before falling back to
sampling-based `auto_bounds(...)`. Small bounded components such as inlet ducts
should not fall back to broad default scan boxes when the graph has exact or
conservative support bounds.

Local edit validation is policy-driven:

- `LocalValidationMode::LocalCacheQuality` is the default runtime path. It
  regenerates the affected blocks, validates those local blocks against the new
  canonical graph, and reports confidence. Coarse-grid residuals and gradient
  percentiles can produce `Partial` telemetry without forcing a full rebuild.
- `LocalValidationMode::FullComparison` is the strict regression path. It
  compares local coverage against a full-domain recomputation and falls back
  when the dirty region is under-specified.

The conditioned kernel exposes `inside_outside(...)`,
`closest_surface_point(...)`, `ray_intersection(...)`, `gradient(...)`,
`surface_normal(...)`, and `project_to_surface(...)` backed by the conditioned
cache. It also exposes `canonical_distance(...)` for raw source-field debugging and
`from_conditionable_metadata(...)` for constructing a conditioned kernel from a
bounded metadata tree.

Headless metrics schema version 3 includes a `conditioning` object copied from
live cache metadata. It records cache state, generation, block count, spacing,
interface band, confidence, anchor counts, narrow-band block count, and max
iteration count alongside geometry validation.

Graph metadata is also integral. Supported SDF nodes should expose their own
support bounds, dependencies, and feature ownership through `Sdf::metadata()`
as part of normal tree evaluation. Do not build separate post-export metadata
maps when the node can report the information directly.
Profile/path-driven nodes should surface their source bounds through
`Section2D::bounds_2d()` and `SweepPath::support_bounds()` so sweeps, lofts,
inlets, and ducts can derive dirty regions from the active geometry tree.
`Section2D::metadata_fingerprint_parameters()` and
`SweepPath::metadata_fingerprint_parameters()` should report shape-driving
values so same-envelope profile/path edits still invalidate the conditioned
cache. Metadata is locality evidence, not the geometry definition; the
canonical `distance(point)` implementation remains the source of truth.
Boolean and smooth-boolean nodes should use operation metadata to propagate
changed child dirty regions into nearby sibling/interface bands by spatial
radius, not by aircraft-specific wing/fuselage semantics.
Deformation nodes should preserve conservative child-derived bounds when they
can prove a finite envelope; `Twist` bounds the child's swept radial extent
around the twist axis, and `Bend` bounds the child's bend-plane radius plus
preserved perpendicular interval.

Bound quality must be propagated whenever a node rewrites support metadata. Use
`set_support_bounds(...)` or the metadata builder helpers rather than assigning
`support_bounds` directly. Exact primitive bounds should stay exact. Booleans,
rotations, arrays, sweeps, lofts, offsets, shells, and deformation envelopes are
usually conservative. Mesh-backed and field-driven nodes are estimated until
they have stronger validity or range contracts. Nodes that cannot prove finite
support should remain unknown and force full conditioning.

Supported geometry nodes should emit their own conditioning edits when a
parameter changes. Current examples include sphere radius, cylinder dimensions,
translation offset, smooth blend radius, offset distance, and shell thickness.
For bounded profile/path/section updates without a specialized helper, compare
the previous and next `SdfNodeMetadata` with `GeometryEdit::metadata_changed`.
It emits a feature dirty region from the union of both support bounds and
returns `None` when bounds are missing, invalid, or unknown-quality so the
kernel can fall back safely.

#### Primitives (`sdf/primitives.rs`)

| Type | Constructor | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Sphere` | `Sphere::new(radius: f32)` | Sphere centered at origin |
| `SdfBox` | `SdfBox::new(half_extents: Vec3)` | Box centered at origin; half_extents are half-dimensions |
| `Cylinder` | `Cylinder::new(radius: f32, half_height: f32)` | Cylinder along Z axis |
| `Torus` | `Torus::new(major_radius: f32, minor_radius: f32)` | Torus in XY plane |
| `Cone` | `Cone::new(radius: f32, height: f32)` | Cone, tip at origin, base in -Z direction |
| `Plane` | `Plane::new(normal: Vec3, distance: f32)` | Infinite half-space |

**Note on `SdfBox`**: The Rhai API takes `width, height, depth` as full dimensions and divides by 2 internally. Rust code takes `half_extents` directly.

**Note on `Cylinder`**: The Rhai API takes `height` as total height; the constructor takes `half_height`.

#### Booleans (`sdf/booleans.rs`)

| Type | Formula | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Union` | `min(a, b)` | Combines two bodies |
| `Subtract` | `max(a, -b)` | Removes b from a |
| `Intersect` | `max(a, b)` | Keeps only the overlap |
| `SmoothUnion` | IQ polynomial smin | Smooth union with blend radius |
| `SmoothSubtract` | IQ opSmoothSubtraction | Smooth removal with chamfer |
| `SmoothIntersect` | IQ polynomial smax | Smooth intersection |

The smooth operations use Inigo Quilez's polynomial blending formulas. The `k` / `smoothness` parameter controls the blend radius in scene units.

#### Transforms (`sdf/transforms.rs`)

| Type | Constructor | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Translate` | `Translate::new(child, offset: Vec3)` | Translate by offset vector |
| `Rotate` | `Rotate::new(child, rotation: Quat)` | Rotate by quaternion (inverse applied to query point) |
| `Scale` | `Scale::new(child, scale: Vec3)` | Non-uniform scale (min scale used for distance correction) |
| `Offset` | `Offset::new(child, distance: f32)` | Expand (positive) or shrink (negative) by distance |
| `Shell` | `Shell::new(child, thickness: f32)` | Hollow shell — keeps surface band of given thickness |
| `Twist` | `Twist::new(child, axis: Vec3, rate: f32)` | Twist around axis by `rate` degrees/unit (approximate SDF) |
| `Bend` | `Bend::new(child, axis: Vec3, curvature: f32)` | Bend along axis by curvature rad/unit (approximate SDF) |

**Important**: `Twist` and `Bend` produce approximate (non-Lipschitz-1) SDFs. Do not use them for precise offset operations. Safe for marching cubes and raymarching at moderate deformation.

#### Patterns (`sdf/patterns.rs`)

- `LinearArray`: copies an SDF at regular intervals along a direction vector
- `PolarArray`: copies an SDF in a radial pattern around an axis
- `Mirror`: reflects an SDF across a plane (defined by normal)

#### Aerospace (`sdf/aerospace/`)

```rust
pub trait Field: Send + Sync {
    fn value(&self, point: Vec3) -> f32;
}
```

Field types:
- `ConstantField(f32)`: uniform scalar value everywhere
- `SdfField`: wraps an SDF, uses its distance value as the field
- `PositionXField`, `PositionYField`, `PositionZField`: use coordinate axis as field

### 5.2 `mesh` — Mesh Extraction

**Path**: `src/mesh/`

#### Types

```rust
pub struct Vertex {
    pub position: [f32; 3],
    pub normal: [f32; 3],
}

pub struct Mesh {
    pub vertices: Vec<Vertex>,
    pub indices: Vec<u32>,
}
```

`Vertex` is `#[repr(C)]` and derives `Pod + Zeroable` (bytemuck) so it can be uploaded directly to GPU buffers without copying.

#### `compute_volume(mesh: &Mesh) -> f32`

Computes signed mesh volume using the divergence theorem (signed tetrahedral volumes summed over all triangles). Units are scene units cubed (mm³ if scene is in mm).

#### Marching Cubes (`mesh/marching_cubes.rs`)

Standard uniform-grid marching cubes. Evaluates the SDF at each grid vertex, interpolates crossing points, generates triangles. Used for preview at coarse resolution.

Status note:

- Keep this section as legacy/reference behavior.
- Do not assume marching cubes is the desired future STL/export path.
- If you are working on new export architecture, use this code primarily as a baseline to compare against or to remove/replace safely.

#### Adaptive Marching Cubes (`mesh/adaptive_mc.rs`)

Parallel adaptive marching cubes with quality settings:

```rust
pub enum MeshQuality {
    Draft,    // fast, low poly
    Standard, // balanced
    Fine,     // high quality
    Ultra,    // maximum detail
}
```

This is the primary mesh extraction path used by the app. Parallelized with rayon.

Status note:

- This has been the active STL/aero export path under investigation.
- It is currently documented here so a new agent understands the existing implementation and its failure modes.
- It should not be treated as a protected long-term direction for STL export work.

#### Mesh Import (`mesh/import.rs`)

```rust
pub struct TriangleMesh {
    pub vertices: Vec<Vec3>,
    pub triangles: Vec<[u32; 3]>,
}

pub struct MeshValidationResult { ... }

pub fn parse_stl(data: &[u8]) -> Result<TriangleMesh, String>;
pub fn parse_obj(data: &str) -> Result<TriangleMesh, String>;
pub fn validate_mesh(mesh: &TriangleMesh) -> MeshValidationResult;
```

Used by `sdf/mesh_import.rs` to create closest-point SDFs from imported geometry, and by the scripting API's `import_mesh()` function. Mesh parse results are cached in `MeshCache` (keyed by path + mtime).

---

### 5.3 `render` — Rendering System

**Path**: `src/render/`

All rendering is done via wgpu as custom rendering passes inside eframe's egui integration. The render system does not use egui's painter; it uses raw wgpu commands.

#### `Camera` (`render/camera.rs`)

Orbit camera around a target point:
- Left-drag: orbit
- Right-drag: pan
- Scroll: zoom

Exposes view matrix, projection matrix, and `eye_position()`.

#### `RenderState` (`render/pipeline.rs`)

Core wgpu state: device, queue, surface, render pipeline for mesh drawing. Handles vertex/index buffer management, shader loading from `shaders/mesh.wgsl`.

Shading modes:
- Flat shading (per-face normals)
- Smooth shading (per-vertex normals from marching cubes)

#### `GridRenderer` (`render/grid.rs`)

Renders an infinite grid plane in the viewport.

#### `AxesRenderer` (`render/axes.rs`)

Renders XYZ axis indicators (colored arrows/lines in the viewport corner).

#### `WireframeRenderer` (`render/wireframe.rs`)

Renders the mesh as a wireframe overlay.

#### `RaymarchRenderer`, `SdfGrid`, `SectionUniforms`, `ThicknessUniforms` (`render/raymarch.rs`)

GPU raymarching renderer for:
- Real-time SDF preview (without full marching cubes)
- Section view clipping (slice through the model)
- Thickness visualization (heat map of wall thickness)

`SdfGrid` is a voxel grid representation of the SDF uploaded to the GPU as a 3D texture for raymarching.

---

### 5.4 `scripting` — Rhai Engine

**Path**: `src/scripting/`

#### Engine Lifecycle

A new `rhai::Engine` is created on every script evaluation call. All functions are re-registered each time. This is intentional — it ensures no state leaks between evaluations and simplifies the design.

#### `evaluate_script(source: &str) -> Result<ScriptResult, String>`

Convenience wrapper. No profiles, spine, or FEA field access.

#### `evaluate_script_with_profiles(source, profiles, splines) -> Result<ScriptResult, String>`

Used by the app for scripts that use `spline()` or `spline_section()`.

#### `evaluate_script_full(...)` — Full Evaluator

```rust
pub fn evaluate_script_full(
    source:             &str,
    profiles:           Option<Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, SplineProfile>>>>,
    splines:            Option<Arc<LongitudinalSplines>>,
    stress_field:       Option<Arc<dyn Field>>,
    displacement_field: Option<Arc<dyn Field>>,
    dimensions:         &indexmap::IndexMap<String, f64>,
    project_dir:        Option<&Path>,
    mesh_cache:         Option<Arc<Mutex<MeshCache>>>,
    library_sources:    &[(String, String)],
) -> Result<ScriptResult, String>
```

Parameters:
- `profiles`: resolves `spline(name)` and `spline_section(name)` calls
- `splines`: resolves `spline_fuselage(stations, length)` calls
- `stress_field` / `displacement_field`: FEA result fields available as `stress_field()` / `displacement_field()` in scripts
- `dimensions`: named constants injected as Rhai constants into the script scope
- `project_dir`: base directory for resolving relative mesh paths in `import_mesh()`
- `mesh_cache`: shared cache of parsed STL/OBJ meshes (keyed by path + mtime)
- `library_sources`: list of `(module_name, rhai_source)` pairs registered as static Rhai modules

#### `ScriptResult`

```rust
pub struct ScriptResult {
    pub sdf:              Arc<dyn Sdf>,
    pub mass_points:      Vec<MassPoint>,
    pub fea_setup:        FEASetup,
    pub layups:           Vec<Arc<CompositeLayup>>,
    pub reference_points: Vec<ReferencePoint>,
}
```

Methods:
- `center_of_gravity() -> Option<Vec3>`: weighted average of mass points
- `total_mass_g() -> f32`: sum of all declared masses

#### Script Cell System

Scripts can be divided into named sections using delimiter comments:
```
# === Section Name ===
```

`parse_cells(script: &str) -> Vec<ScriptCell>` parses these delimiters. If no delimiters are present, a single cell named "Script" covers the entire script.

```rust
pub struct ScriptCell {
    pub id: String,         // "cell_0", "cell_1", etc.
    pub name: String,       // human-readable name from delimiter
    pub start_line: usize,  // 0-indexed line of delimiter
    pub end_line: usize,    // 0-indexed inclusive last line
    pub status: CellStatus,
}

pub enum CellStatus {
    Pending,
    Ok,
    Error { message: String, line: Option<usize> },
    Skipped,
}
```

#### Error Formatting (`scripting/errors.rs`)

`format_script_error(source, message)` — enriches error messages with line context. `build_error_string(formatted)` — formats the final error string for display in the UI.

Special case: if a script ends with a semicolon on the last line, the return type is `()` instead of `SdfHandle`, and the engine produces a misleading "output type incorrect" error. The evaluator catches this pattern and produces a friendly "Script must end with an SDF expression" message.

---

### 5.5 `ui` — User Interface

**Path**: `src/ui/`

UI components are egui panels rendered from `app.rs`. The UI module provides specialized panel functions.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `mod.rs` | Panel dispatch, overall UI layout helpers |

## 6. Scripting API Reference

All functions below are registered in `src/scripting/api.rs` and available in Rhai scripts. All geometry functions return `SdfHandle`. Functions that perform analysis return Rhai maps or typed handles.

**Important script convention**: the last expression in a script (without a trailing semicolon) must be an `SdfHandle`. This is what gets meshed and displayed. If the last line ends with `;`, evaluation will fail with a type error.

---

cylinder(radius, height)               // SdfHandle — cylinder along Z, centered at origin
torus(major_radius, minor_radius)      // SdfHandle — torus in XY plane

trim_result_to_map(result)                    // Map from TrimResultHandle
drag_polar_to_map(result)                     // Map from DragPolarHandle
```

### 6.16 Propulsion Analysis

```rhai
motor(name)                           // MotorHandle — look up by name (e.g. "T-Motor F80")
motor_custom(kv, max_current_a, weight_g, diameter_mm)  // MotorHandle
list_motors()                         // Array of motor name strings

prop(name)                            // PropHandle — look up by name
prop_by_size(diameter_in, pitch_in)   // PropHandle
prop_custom(diameter_in, pitch_in, ct0, ct_slope, cp0, cp_slope)  // PropHandle
list_props()                          // Array of prop name strings

propulsion_setup(motor, prop, cells, cap_mah)  // PropulsionHandle
propulsion_setup_full(motor, prop, cells, cap_mah, max_continuous_a, kv_override)  // PropulsionHandle

propulsion_analysis(setup, fc, weight_n)  // Map
// Returns: {thrust_n, power_w, current_a, efficiency, rpm, ...}

propulsion_thrust_at(setup, airspeed_ms, fc)  // f64 — thrust at given airspeed

range_endurance(setup, wing_sdf, fuse_sdf, htail_sdf, vtail_sdf, fc, weight_n)  // Map
rate_of_climb(setup, wing_sdf, fuse_sdf, htail_sdf, vtail_sdf, fc, weight_n)   // Map
glide_performance(wing_sdf, fuse_sdf, htail_sdf, vtail_sdf, fc, weight_n)      // Map

recommend_motor_prop(thrust_n, cruise_ms, max_weight_g)  // Array of Maps
```

Propulsion was added in the session ending 2026-03-17. The motor database has 8 motors and 10 props. `propulsion_analysis` runs an iterative RPM convergence algorithm.

---

### 6.17 Mass and CG Tracking

```rhai
mass_at(mass_g, x, y, z)             // declares a point mass (no geometry returned)
mass_named(name, mass_g, x, y, z)    // named point mass
ref_point(name, x, y, z)             // declares a named reference point (shown in viewer)
```

Mass points are accumulated during script evaluation and accessible via `ScriptResult::mass_points` and `ScriptResult::center_of_gravity()`.

---

### 6.18 FEA Setup

```rhai
fea_material(preset_name)             // sets material: "Aluminum6061", "Steel4130", etc.
fea_resolution(n)                     // sets voxel mesh resolution

fea_fix_x(x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max)   // fixed boundary in X direction
fea_fix_y(...)                        // fixed boundary in Y
fea_fix_z(...)                        // fixed boundary in Z
fea_fix_all(...)                      // fully fixed boundary

fea_force(x, y, z, fx, fy, fz)       // point force at position
fea_pressure(x_min, x_max, ..., pressure_pa)  // distributed pressure
fea_torque(cx, cy, cz, tx, ty, tz)   // torque load
fea_motor_load(position, thrust_n, torque_nm, axis_x, axis_y, axis_z)  // motor load
```

FEA setup declarations accumulate in `FEASetup` during script evaluation. The FEA pipeline is triggered separately from the UI.

---

### 6.19 Reference Points and Queries

```rhai
ref_point(name, x, y, z)             // declares a named reference point
point(x, y, z)                        // PointHandle — a 3D point
snap_to_surface_fn(body, point)       // PointHandle — nearest surface point
```

Reference points are rendered as colored spheres in the viewport with name labels.

---

### 6.20 Mesh Import

```rhai
import_mesh(path)                     // SdfHandle — import STL or OBJ as closest-point SDF
```

Path can be relative to the project directory. Mesh files are cached; re-parsed only when the file's mtime changes.

**Important**: Mesh-as-SDF is a closest-point SDF wrapper, not a true mathematical SDF. It is expensive to evaluate. For marching cubes, prefer using it at coarser resolutions or for small meshes. For large or complex imported meshes, the distance query is O(triangles).

---

### 6.21 Dimensions (Named Constants)

Dimensions are defined in the project's Dimensions panel (not in the script itself). They are injected as Rhai constants into the script scope before evaluation:

```rhai
// If "wingspan" = 800.0 is defined in the Dimensions panel:
let wing = wing("2412", root_chord, root_chord * 0.6, wingspan / 2.0, 15.0);
```

Named dimensions appear as `const` bindings — they cannot be reassigned in the script.

---

### 6.22 Script Cell System

Divide a script into sections using delimiter comments:

```rhai
# === Fuselage ===
let fuse = fuselage_parametric(400.0, 80.0, 60.0, 0.3, 0.4);

# === Wing ===
let wing = wing("2412", 120.0, 80.0, 300.0, 5.0);

# === Final Assembly ===
union(fuse, wing)
```

In notebook mode, each cell can be run independently. The cell delimiter syntax is: `# ===` at the start, `===` at the end, with the cell name in between.

---

## 7. Data Flow and Evaluation Pipeline

### Normal Script Evaluation

Return SdfHandle
```

---

## 8. Rhai Type Handles

All Rust types exposed to Rhai scripts are wrapped in newtype handles. These are `Clone` (backed by `Arc` or by copying small structs).

| Handle Type | Wraps | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SdfHandle` | `Arc<dyn Sdf>` | SDF geometry object |
| `FieldHandle` | `Arc<dyn Field>` | Scalar field |
| `SectionHandle` | `Arc<dyn Section2D>` | 2D cross-section shape |
| `StationHandle` | `{ position: f32, section: Arc<dyn Section2D> }` | Fuselage station |
| `ComponentHandle` | `{ geometry, keepout, mass_g, name }` | Placed component with clearance |
| `PathHandle` | `Arc<dyn SweepPath>` | Sweep path |
| `ProfileHandle` | `Arc<dyn Section2D>` | 2D sweep profile |
| `MaterialHandle` | `Arc<CompositeMaterial>` | Composite material spec |
| `LayerHandle` | `Arc<ShellLayer>` | Composite shell layer |
| `LayupConfigHandle` | `Vec<Arc<ShellLayer>>` | Composite layup stack |
| `HingeHandle` | `HingeSpec` | Control surface hinge |
| `LinkageHandle` | `LinkageSpec` | Control surface linkage |
| `PointHandle` | `Vec3` | 3D point |
| `MountingHoleHandle` | `MountingHole` | Single mounting hole |
| `MountingHoleSetHandle` | `MountingHoleSet` | Set of mounting holes |
| `PolarHandle` | `Arc<AirfoilPolar>` | Airfoil polar data |
| `FlightConditionHandle` | `FlightCondition` | Flight condition |
| `StabilityResultHandle` | `StaticMarginResult` | Stability analysis result |
| `TrimResultHandle` | `TrimResult` | Trim analysis result |
| `DragPolarHandle` | `DragPolarResult` | Drag polar result |
| `MotorHandle` | `Arc<MotorSpec>` | Motor specification |
| `PropHandle` | `Arc<PropSpec>` | Propeller specification |
| `PropulsionHandle` | `Arc<PropulsionSetup>` | Motor+prop+battery system |

**Important implementation detail**: handles are `Clone` because Rhai requires this for all registered types. The `Arc` wrappers make cloning cheap (reference count increment, no deep copy). The `Sdf` and `Field` traits require `Send + Sync` for rayon parallelism.

---

## 9. Project File Format

Project files are JSON (`.implicitcad` or `.json` extension). The root is a `Project` struct:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "script": "let s = sphere(10.0);\ns",
  "resolution": 64,
  "smooth_normals": false,
  "show_wireframe": false,
  "camera_position": [0.0, -200.0, 100.0],
  "camera_target": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
  "timestamp": "2026-03-17T12:00:00Z",
  "dimensions": {
    "wingspan": 800.0,
    "root_chord": 120.0
  },
  "section_view": {
    "plane_a": { "axis": "X", "position": 0.0, "enabled": false, "flip": false },
    "plane_b": null
  },
  "fea_config": null,
  "node_graph": null,
  "notebook": null,
  "profiles": null,
  "splines": null,
  "print_analysis_settings": null
}
```

Optional fields (`Option<T>`) are omitted when `None`. The `dimensions` map (`IndexMap`) preserves insertion order.

**Serialization**: `serde_json::to_string_pretty` / `serde_json::from_str`. Project auto-saves are written to the same path periodically.

---

## 10. Rendering Architecture

The app uses eframe's wgpu integration. Custom rendering happens via `egui_wgpu::CallbackTrait`.

### Render Passes (per frame)

1. **Background**: egui draws the UI panels
2. **Viewport callback**: custom wgpu render pass, executed inside the egui viewport panel:
   a. Grid pass (`GridRenderer`)
   b. Axes pass (`AxesRenderer`)
   c. Mesh pass (`RenderState`) — draws the SDF-extracted mesh
   d. Wireframe pass (`WireframeRenderer`) — optional overlay
   e. Raymarch pass (`RaymarchRenderer`) — section view clipping or thickness heat map

### Shader (`shaders/mesh.wgsl`)

Vertex + fragment shader for mesh rendering:
- Input: `position: vec3<f32>`, `normal: vec3<f32>`
- Uniform: model-view-projection matrix, camera eye position, shading mode
- Lighting: single directional light + ambient term
- Output: per-vertex (smooth) or per-face (flat) shading in a neutral gray-blue color

### Camera (`render/camera.rs`)

Orbit camera parameterized by:
- `target: Vec3` — look-at point (orbit center)
- `distance: f32` — distance from target
- `yaw: f32`, `pitch: f32` — spherical angles

Controls:
- Left mouse drag → orbit (change yaw/pitch)
- Right mouse drag → pan (move target)
- Scroll wheel → zoom (change distance)

### Section View

Section view uses the `RaymarchRenderer` with `SectionUniforms` specifying up to two clipping planes. Each plane is defined by an axis (X/Y/Z) and a position. The `flip` field determines which side of the plane is kept.

### Thickness Visualization

The `RaymarchRenderer` with `ThicknessUniforms` computes per-pixel wall thickness via dual ray marching (outward and inward from each surface point) and colors the result as a heat map (blue = thin, red = thick).

---

## 11. FEA Pipeline Details

### Boundary Condition Types

Declared via Rhai `fea_*()` functions, stored in `FEASetup`:

| Rhai Function | Rust Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `fea_fix_x/y/z/all()` | `FEAAxisRegion` | Fixed displacement boundary |
| `fea_force()` | `FEAForceRegion` | Point or distributed force |
| `fea_pressure()` | `FEAPressureRegion` | Surface pressure load |
| `fea_torque()` | `FEATorqueRegion` | Torque load |
| `fea_motor_load()` | `FEAMotorRegion` | Combined thrust + torque from motor |

### Material Presets

```rust
pub enum MaterialPreset {
    Aluminum6061,
    Steel4130,
    CarbonFiberUD,
    FiberglassWoven,
    PLA,
    PETG,
    Nylon,
    // ...
}
```

Each preset defines `E` (Young's modulus), `nu` (Poisson's ratio), `rho` (density), `yield_strength`.

### FEA Messages

The `FEAPipeline` communicates progress via an `mpsc` channel of `FEAMessage`:
```rust
pub enum FEAMessage {
    Progress { stage: String, percent: f32 },
    Result(FEAGridResult),
    Error(String),
}
```

The UI polls this channel and updates progress indicators.

### Grid Fields

```rust
pub struct GridField {
    pub values: Vec<f32>,      // flat array of field values on regular grid
    pub grid_dims: [usize; 3], // grid dimensions (nx, ny, nz)
    pub bounds_min: Vec3,
    pub bounds_max: Vec3,
}
```

Grid fields can be passed back into script evaluation as `stress_field` / `displacement_field` for field-driven post-processing (e.g., remove material where stress is low).

---

## 12. Testing Conventions

Tests are co-located with source files in `#[cfg(test)]` modules and in `tests/` for integration tests.

### Unit Test Pattern

Each module with non-trivial logic has a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block. Key test coverage:

- `sdf/primitives.rs`: sphere, box, cylinder, torus, cone, plane — boundary, surface, exterior points
- `sdf/booleans.rs`: union, subtract, intersect, smooth_intersect — mathematical properties
- `sdf/transforms.rs`: translate, rotate, scale, twist (zero rate = identity, twist rotates), bend (zero = identity, curves shape)
- `sdf/mod.rs`: compound SDF integration test (box - sphere)
- `aero/propulsion.rs`: 5 tests — motor lookup, CT at zero/Jmax, static thrust, thrust vs airspeed, max airspeed
- `aero/performance.rs`: 3 tests — endurance at best speed, range at best range speed, glide ratio

### Running Tests

```
cargo test
```

Expected: all tests pass. As of 2026-03-17: 328 tests pass, 0 fail.

### Test File Conventions

- Unit tests live in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the bottom of each source file
- Integration tests live in `tests/`
- Test scripts (Rhai) live in `test_scripts/`

### Adding New Tests

When adding new functionality, add the minimum tests that would have caught the bug or validated the feature. For SDF primitives: test inside, on surface, and outside. For analysis functions: test known-good values and boundary conditions.

---

## 13. Engineering Conventions

### Coordinate System

- **X**: forward (aircraft nose direction for aerospace geometry)
- **Y**: left/right (span direction for wings)
- **Z**: up (altitude direction)

All geometry is in millimeters by default (though no units are enforced — the SDF is dimensionless). If you work in meters, all dimensions and forces must be consistent.

### SDF Sign Convention

- **Negative distance**: inside the geometry (solid material)
- **Zero**: on the surface
- **Positive distance**: outside the geometry (air)

Marching cubes extracts the zero-isosurface. The mesh surface is where `distance = 0`.

### Arc<dyn Sdf> Pattern

All SDF nodes in the tree are `Arc<dyn Sdf>`. New SDF types must:
1. Implement `Sdf` trait (`fn distance(&self, point: Vec3) -> f32`)
2. Implement `Send + Sync` (usually automatic if all fields are `Send + Sync`)
3. Be constructable into `Arc<Self>` for composition

### Error Handling

- Script evaluation errors are returned as `Err(String)` and displayed in the UI error panel
- Panics are not acceptable in production paths; use `Result<>` or `Option<>`
- FEA errors are reported via `FEAMessage::Error(String)` channel

### Module Boundaries

- `sdf`: no dependencies on other project modules — pure geometry
- `mesh`: only depends on `sdf` (for the `Sdf` trait parameter)
- `aero`: no dependencies on other project modules — pure analysis
- `materials`: no dependencies on other project modules
- `scripting/api.rs`: the main integration point — imports from all other modules

### Numeric Types

- SDF distances: `f32`
- Script API: accepts `f64` from Rhai (Rhai's native float type) and casts to `f32` at the API boundary
- Geometry math: `glam::Vec3` (f32), `glam::Quat` (f32), `glam::Mat4` (f32)
- Analysis values (aerodynamic, mass): `f32` internally, `f64` in Rhai return maps

---

## 14. Common Patterns

### Adding a New SDF Primitive

1. Add struct + `impl Sdf` in `src/sdf/primitives.rs` (or a new file in `sdf/`)
2. Add `pub use` in the relevant `mod.rs`
3. Add `register_fn` in `src/scripting/api.rs` (in the appropriate `register_*` function)
4. Add unit tests in the same file
5. Update this reference document

**Template**:
```rust
pub struct MyShape {
    pub param: f32,
}

impl MyShape {
    pub fn new(param: f32) -> Self { Self { param } }
}

impl Sdf for MyShape {
    fn distance(&self, point: Vec3) -> f32 {
        // return signed distance
    }
}
```

Registration in api.rs:
```rust
engine.register_fn("my_shape", |param: f64| {
    SdfHandle(Arc::new(MyShape::new(param as f32)))
});
```

### Adding a New Rhai Function

1. Open `src/scripting/api.rs`
2. Find the appropriate `register_*` function or create a new one
3. Add `engine.register_fn("function_name", |args| { ... });`
4. If the function needs state (e.g., an accumulator), pass it as a captured `Arc<Mutex<T>>`
5. Add the function to the `register_sdf_functions` dispatcher if needed
6. Document in this reference under Section 6

### Adding a New Handle Type

1. Add the struct to `src/scripting/mod.rs`
2. Add `engine.register_type::<MyHandle>()` in `register_sdf_functions` or the appropriate `register_*` function
3. Register any methods on the handle if needed

### Adding Analysis Functions

Pattern from propulsion analysis (latest addition, 2026-03-17):
1. Implement analysis logic in the appropriate analysis module (`aero/`, `analysis/`, etc.)
2. Add pub use in the module's `mod.rs`
3. Add handle types in `scripting/mod.rs`
4. Add `register_*_functions(engine)` in `scripting/api.rs`
5. Call the new registration function from `register_sdf_functions()`
6. Add unit tests in the analysis module

---

## 15. Scope Boundaries and Non-Goals

From MasterPlan.md — what is explicitly in scope vs out of scope.

### Currently In Scope

- SDF-based geometry: primitives, booleans, transforms, patterns, aerospace shapes
- Rhai scripting API covering all geometry operations
- Marching cubes mesh extraction (uniform and adaptive)
- egui desktop application with code editor and 3D viewport
- Camera: orbit, pan, zoom
- Flat and smooth shading
- Section view (clip planes)
- Thickness visualization
- STL export
- Project file save/load (JSON)
- Named dimensions (parametric constants)
- Undo/redo
- Component placement system with keepout zones
- Mass and CG tracking
- Aerodynamic analysis (lifting line, static margin, drag polar, propulsion, performance)
- FEA via CalculiX
- Composite layup modeling
- Control surface generation
- Print/manufacturing features (split, alignment, tolerance compensation)
- Field-driven operations (variable offset, shell, blend)
- Lattice infill (gyroid, diamond, cubic, conformal variants)
- Node graph editor (code generation from visual nodes)
- Notebook mode (cell-based scripting)
- User component library
- Version control snapshots
- Geometry analysis (measurements, hole detection, CG sensitivity, interference)

### Out of Scope / Not Planned

- GPU-accelerated SDF evaluation (future phase)
- Multi-body assemblies with constraint solving
- B-Rep or NURBS geometry
- Cross-platform builds (macOS, Linux) — architecture supports it but not targeted
- Auto-completion beyond current implementation
- Real-time typing → mesh update (intentional design decision: requires explicit run)
- STEP import/export
- Full CFD simulation (lifting line + basic drag polar is the extent)
- DXF/drawing output
- Multi-user collaboration

---

## 16. Known Constraints and Gotchas

### Rhai `box` Keyword Conflict

`box` is a Rust keyword (used for `Box<T>`). The function must be named `box_` in both the Rhai API and in scripts. Do not attempt to register a function named `box` — it will not compile.

### Script Must End Without Semicolon

The last expression in a script must be an `SdfHandle` (not `SdfHandle;`). If the last line ends with a semicolon, Rhai returns `()` and the evaluator produces an error. The error formatter catches this and shows a friendly message.

### SDF Evaluation Cost

SDF evaluation is the hot path. Complex SDF trees (deep boolean hierarchies, mesh-as-SDF) can be slow when evaluated at high marching cubes resolutions. Profile before optimizing.

For `import_mesh()`, the closest-point SDF wrapper iterates all triangles per query point at O(n_triangles) per call. For large meshes, use coarser marching cubes resolution.

### Approximate SDFs

`Twist` and `Bend` produce approximate (non-Lipschitz-1) SDFs. They are correct at zero deformation but the distance property degrades at high twist rates or high curvature. Symptoms: marching cubes may produce artifacts at high deformation values. Do not use for precision offset operations.

### Rayon Thread Count

Rayon uses all available cores for parallel SDF evaluation. This is generally desirable but can interfere with UI responsiveness during mesh extraction. Consider wrapping expensive extractions in `std::thread::spawn` + channel if UI freezes are a problem.

### Rhai Engine Per Evaluation

A fresh `rhai::Engine` is constructed on every `evaluate_script_full()` call. This means:
- All function registration overhead is paid on every evaluation
- There is no persistent state between evaluations
- Library modules are re-compiled and registered on every evaluation

For very fast re-evaluation, consider caching the compiled library ASTs.

### MeshCache Keyed by mtime

The `MeshCache` invalidates on mtime change. If a mesh file is modified but has the same mtime (e.g., written by a tool that does not update mtime), the old cached version will be served. This is an edge case; normal workflow is unaffected.

### Coordinate Convention for Aerospace

Aerospace geometry is built in a right-handed coordinate system with X=forward, Y=right (or left depending on convention), Z=up. The `wing_with_airfoil` function extrudes the wing along +Y and -Y from the centerline. Fuselage is oriented along the X axis.

### NACA Airfoil Digit String

`airfoil("2412", chord)` takes a string of 4 digits, not a number. Always quote it: `"2412"`, not `2412`. `is_valid_naca_4digit(s)` validates the string before use.

### Propulsion Database

The motor database (`propulsion_db.rs`) has 8 motors and 10 propellers hardcoded. `list_motors()` and `list_props()` return the available names. For motors or props not in the database, use `motor_custom()` and `prop_custom()`.

### FEA Requires CalculiX Binary

The FEA pipeline (`fea/calculix.rs`) spawns CalculiX as an external subprocess. The path to the CalculiX binary must be set in `AppSettings`. If CalculiX is not installed or the path is wrong, the FEA run will fail with an error message in the UI.

### Section View Dual Planes

The `SectionView` supports up to two clipping planes (`plane_a` and `plane_b`). Both can be enabled simultaneously for a cross-section cut. Only axis-aligned planes (X, Y, Z) are supported; arbitrary plane clipping is a future feature.
